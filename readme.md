Split is a centrally-divided theme for the modern professional. Features include a big image left (or right) with alongside customizable content.

## Split uses the free FullSingle plugin
The Split WordPress theme uses the free [FullSingle plugin by One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/go/fullsingle) to insert and edit the Split layout. Please watch the [FullSingle setup video](https://onepagelove.com/go/fullsingle-setup) to get going.

ps. did you know if you keep the FullSingle plugin activated, you can switch to any WordPress theme (maybe you want a specific blog design) and the Split layout will look exactly the same üôè
